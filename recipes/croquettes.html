    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Croquetas de jamón, or ham croquettes, 
        are a staple on Spanish tapas menus, and 
        you'll find them offered throughout the country.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>60 g unsalted butter (60 g)</li>
        <li>60 ml olive oil (60 ml)</li>
        <li>120 g flour (just under one cup — 120 g)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion very finely diced</li>
        <li>1 l whole milk at room temperature (1 liter)</li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>225 g jamón serrano diced into small pieces (225 g)</li>
        <li>flour for breading</li>
        <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
        <li>bread crumbs for breading (try Panko for non-traditional extra crispy croquettes!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and warm the oil in 
            a heavy pan over medium high heat.</li>
        
        <li>Add the diced onion and sauté for a 
            few minutes, until it just starts to color.</li>
        
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and the nutmeg. Don't add 
            too much salt as the Serrano ham is already salty.</li>
        
        <li>Add the diced ham and sauté for 30 seconds more.</li>
        
        <li>Add the flour and stir continuously, until 
            the flour turns a light brown color. 
            You must not stop stirring or the flour will burn!</li>
        
        <li>When the flour changes color, add the milk 
            little by little, always stirring until you 
            incorporate the entire amount. It should 
            take about 15-20 minutes to add it all.</li>
        
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the dough cool to room temperature.</li>
        
        <li>Butter the sides of a large bowl and place 
            the croquette dough inside, covered directly 
            with plastic wrap. Refrigerate a minimum 
            of 4 hours, but preferably overnight.</li>
        
        <li>To make the ham croquettes, shape them into 
            little logs (or use a pastry sleeve if you have one.)</li>
        
        <li>Next, while heating a pan full of olive oil on 
            the stove, pass the croquettes through the three 
            step breading process. First, cover them in flour, 
            then in egg, and, finally, in the breadcrumbs.</li>
        
        <li>Fry the ham croquettes in the hot oil for about 
            five minutes (making sure to turn halfway so 
            they brown evenly) and then let them cool 
            for a few minutes before enjoying!</li>
    </ol>
